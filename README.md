As a seller,  NFT receipt serves as a digital proof of transfer and transaction for the non-fungible token (NFT) you have sold. It verifies that you have transferred ownership of the unique digital asset or collectible to the buyer. 

WHO IS IT FOR

Which  includes collectors, enthusiasts, investors, and individuals who value the historical significance and provenance of digital assets.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED

Next.js and solidity
Next.js provides the frontend framework for building user interfaces and interacting with the Ethereum network.Solidity enables the creation of smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. 
When it comes to NFT receipts, Next.js and Solidity can be used together to create a system where NFT ownership receipts are stored and managed. Solidity can be used to create smart contracts that represent the ownership of NFTs and store relevant information such as the token ID, owner address, transaction history, and other metadata.
Next.js can then be used to build a frontend interface where users can interact with the NFT receipt system. This interface can display NFT ownership information, allow users to transfer ownership, view transaction history, and perform other relevant actions.
